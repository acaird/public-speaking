# So this isn't cloud native

### Abstract

Developing cloud native applications is exciting, but may be equally as foolish.
In this talk we explore the boundaries between software and infrastructure.
We learn when it is appropriate to blur this boundary in the name of elegance, and warn of the absurdity of blurring it in the name of excitement.
We look at the value in developing applications that are agnostic to cloud infrastructure, and discover how those applications are typically very successful in the cloud.
We learn to respect the infrastructure boundary, and evaluate technical decisions that might cross the line.
The audience will walk away with a new appreciation for **cloud native-less** applications, and respect for running them in a cloud environment.
