# Cloud Native Infrastructure

In this talk we explore the important and often overlooked layer of running a cloud native application, that is the infrastructure that supports it.
We journey through the history of infrastructure and learn where we are on the scale today with tools like Terraform.
We introduce the idea of infrastructure as software, and imagine what is in store for the industry moving forward.
As a maintainer of Kubernetes kops (a successful Kubernetes infrastructure tool) and the creator of Kubicorn (another tool in the same space) I share lessons learned the hard way in building out infrastructure management applications in the cloud.
We address exciting concepts of the new space in infrastructure such as the bootstrap problem, and learn new declaritive infrastructure patterns such as the Reconciler pattern.
We look at how cloud native infrastructure is fundamentally different than conventional infrastructure, and learn how this introduces a new need for advanced testing applications.
The audience will walk away with a clear understanding of where infrastructure is today, and what the future of infrastructure running in the cloud will look like.
