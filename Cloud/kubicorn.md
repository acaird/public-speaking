# Cloud Native Infrastructure with Kubicorn

### Abstract

Kubicorn is an open source Go project released at Gophercon in 2017 that is aimed an solving the Kubernetes infrastructure problem.
On the day after the project was open sourced, it had already climbed to the number 1 fastest growing Go project on GitHub.
This talk will dicuss the reasoning behind the project, and how the core of the tool is developed strictly for cloud native application.
We will clearly identify the problem space with existing infrastructure tooling, and discuss how Kubicorn satisfies new patterns that can easily be vendored in control loops and operators.
Managing infrastructure as a cloud native application is a ground breaking idea, and the project is a shining example of how we can begin to reason about infrastructure in this exciting new cloud native world we are living in.

We will learn how the tool is a lovely implementation of the infrastructure reconciler pattern defined in my book "Cloud Native Infrastructure", and learn the dangers of managing infrastructure in other ways.
The lessons discussed are battle tested, and have been proven over time. The audience will gain a rich understanding of what it means to be cloud native, and how that applies to managing the critical underlying layer of their application.
