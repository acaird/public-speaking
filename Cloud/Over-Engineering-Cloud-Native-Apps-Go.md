# Over engineering cloud native applications with Go

### Abstract

Throughout the history of software, code has always ran on top of some infrastructure.
Today the line separating infrastructure from software is evaporating as our applications evolve into infrastructure and software hybrid models.
The new layer in the stack is exciting, dangerous, unfamiliar, and mysterious, and we call applications running in this layer cloud native.
The Go programming language is notoriously the default language for developing these esoteric new applications.
This talk will explore the nuances of the language as observed in writing software aimed at controlling one of the most complicated layers in the stack, infrastructure.
We explore complex mapping, and concurrency patterns while building eventually consistent systems in the cloud.
We learn about the dangers of over abstraction, and celebrate the victory of clean and expressive code.
We leave the talk with a clear understanding of the dangers of complex code, and appreciation for simple and elegant solutions.
