# Valuable Lessons in Adopting Kubernetes

I tell the story of my introduction to Kubernetes from a DevOps engineer perspective. I talk about what Kubernetes is, and what is solves.
I also talk about how it could have drasticaly changed my career had it existed earlier. 
I talk about Kubernetes best practices, and discuss the challenges the open source community is facing today.
I also mention Microsoft products and how they fit into the big picture of things.
The audience will walk away feeling inspired to use Kubernetes, and feel trust in Microsoft to bring them reliable Kubernetes solutions.
