# Legacy

These are all slide decks that can be viewed with [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) 

I created `zomg` to solve a number of features I wanted from `mdp`

 1) Reliable centering
    - There was weird behavior when you pasted in tabs/spaces into a slide with `mdp`
 2) Remote code execution
    - I would like to execute commands inside of my slides and build them into the presentation
 3) Easy syntax
    - I really want this to just do a few things (center text, change colors, etc)
 4) Easy themes
    - My theme won't present well for everyone, so hopefully I can simplify the colors here
