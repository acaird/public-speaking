# Transcoding self worth into elegant software

### Abstract

In this talk we explore my journey to discovering self worth through a painful and risky gender transition from male to female.
We learn about concrete lessons and valuable patterns uncovered as my love and respect for myself grew over time.
We compare the maturity of my software, my ability to work on a team, and ultimately lead and inspire engineers against my overall self appreciation and self worth.
The user will leave the talk clearly understanding the importance of taking a self health first approach to engineering, as well as understand the dangers of working in a technical space while loathing the person they have become.
