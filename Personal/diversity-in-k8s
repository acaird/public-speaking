# Abstract

An engineer looks at diversity

In this talk we take a technical, and data driven approach to reasoning about diversity in the Kubernetes community. 
We define the "diversity problem" in tech, and look at data driven approaches to solving the problem.
We walk the line between psychology and engineering and discover how everyone (including the most diverse people) are guilty of contributing to the diversity problem.
We learn how we can begin to take small steps in the way we run and organize our community to tame the problem.
