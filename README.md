# Request for me to speak at your event

If you would like to have me attend your event, please familiarize yourself with this page (bookmark if needed) then file an issue in the [official issue tracker](https://github.com/kris-nova/public-speaking/issues). 

We can ask questions there, and if I can make it we will ultimately need someone to make a small PR to this repository so we can begin tracking the event.

## FAQ

**Food preference**: 

I try to focus on vegetarian/vegan meals but it's not a requirement. In general I am always able to take care of myself so please don't block on this.

**Do you have a bio**: 

See above. 

**Best way to contact you**: 

I value brevity. 

If you truly need me for something that you cannot find here you can [email me](mailto:kris@nivenly.com).

**I haven't heard back**: 

I am very busy, and it sometimes takes me weeks to follow up with someone. A gentle `bump` or `ping` reply on a thread is probably the most useful way to raise your concern again.

Please do not send multiple email threads about the same event or entity. I like to keep everything in 1 place.
