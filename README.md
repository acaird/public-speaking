### Bio


  Kris Nova has been involved with free and open source software since childhood. While other kids were busy playing kickball, she was spending her free time in Linux IRC channels.
Open Source Software has been a fundamental part of shaping her as a person and guiding her ways of thinking.

According to [an article she wrote on diversity](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2016/12/14/diversity-scholarship-series-one-software-engineers-unexpected-cloudnativecon-kubecon-experience) for the [CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)](https://www.cncf.io/), she shares:

> Open source software has always been an ideology I keep very close to my heart. In fact, open source software is what helped inspire me to come out as a lesbian in my life. To me, open source software has always represented a wonderful world of science, honesty, and learning. A world where mistakes and failure is encouraged, and growing with your peers is a foundational aspect to success.

She has spent time working in many open source communities. From writing [TCP exploits on the FreeBSD operating system](https://github.com/kris-nova/SYN-spoof/blob/master/sdos.c), to spending time contributing to launchpad bugs and features, to sharing her [home grown code](https://github.com/kris-nova/kssh) in the [PyPi repositories](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kssh/). Her most notable work is in the Kubernetes community.

##### Kubernetes

  Kris is one of the 3 core maintainers for [Kubernetes kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops#getting-involved), and is cited as being one of the few people with tribal knowledge on running Kubernetes on AWS. Her [article on running production Kubernetes clusters on AWS](https://www.nivenly.com/k8s-aws-private-networking/) was the first of it's kind and offers features never before seen in the community. She coded the back end components of the feature set while attending [KubeCon](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon) in Seattle, Washington 2016. It was merged on mid-conference, and highly discussed the following day.

Kris also demonstrates leadership as an [organizer for Kubernetes #sig-aws](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-aws#organizers) where she leads the community towards driving features in running Kubernetes on AWS. She spends countless hours contributing to the community, and coding in `kops`.

##### Professional

Kris has worn a [number of infrastructure and operations hats](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-nova) in her years in the professional community. She has spent time working at successful startups, and has professionally focused on `Go`, `Python`, `Scala`, `C`, and object oriented `Java` and `PHP`. Her roles have always included leadership, mentoring, and she has commonly been the face of **back-end** technologies.

In her career she has always displayed exemplary work in software stability and scalable design. She has worked on many applications, most of which are still in production to this day.

##### Public Speaking

You should probably nominate her to speak at your conference. She is amazing, and writes fabulously in third person.
